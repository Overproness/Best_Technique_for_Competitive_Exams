# Best_Technique_for_Competitive_Exams
Best Technique to answer in a Competivie Exam if you don't know answers and why. 

As Competitive Exams have negative marking so students are always in a dilemma, when to trust their gut feeling and when to not. So, here we will see which technique is the best to use to get the best score if you do not know the answer to a Multiple Choice Question. We will prove which one is the best technique and how to imitate it in Real Life. 



Okay so here is the scenario. There are two children A and B. Both are attempting a competitive exam named ECAT. ECAT has 400 marks in total, with 100 questions. Each question is a multiple choice question, with a total of 4 choices, out of which 1 is correct. If marked correctly, each question gets you four marks, leaving it will cost you nothing extra, while marking it incorrectly costs you 1 mark in negative. For example you attempted 74 questions out of which 2 are wrong. So, your marks are        72*4 - 2*1 = 286. (BTW, This is my actual result. ). The student didn't attempt 26 questions because of doubt.
We will be testing if it is better to leave the doubtful questions or to select a random option. 
Our approach to test this would be to generate a random number between the range 1-4 twice, and if they match we will consider that the student who selected randomly got the answer right. 
We will consider that both the students A and B know the first 72 questions correctly and are doubtful in the rest. This is where their approaches differ, and this is what we're gonna calculate. A uses the safe approach while B uses the random approach.
